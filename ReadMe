# 🚀 AWS Medallion Data Engineering Pipeline (Terraform + Glue + Airflow)

This repository implements an **end-to-end cloud-native data engineering platform** designed to **extract, transform, and store data for analytics and BI consumption** using AWS services and infrastructure-as-code.

The solution follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** and is fully automated, reproducible, and environment-agnostic.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The core goal of this project is to:

- Extract data from **RDS (inside VPC)** and **DynamoDB**
- Land raw data into **Amazon S3 (Bronze layer)**
- Transform data using **AWS Glue ETL (PySpark)**
- Promote curated datasets to **Silver & Gold layers**
- Orchestrate pipelines using **Apache Airflow**
- Manage infrastructure using **Terraform**
- Enable **secure BI access** via Athena + Lake Formation

## ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

### 1️⃣ Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
Responsible for **secure data extraction from RDS inside VPC**.
Creates: VPC Endpoints, Glue Connections (JDBC), Crawlers, and IAM Roles. Ensures **private ingestion** without public internet exposure.

### 2️⃣ Transformation (Silver & Gold)
Used to deploy **Glue ETL pipelines** across environments (`dev / stage / prod`).
Creates: Glue Jobs, Crawlers, and Job parameters. Terraform **reduces manual effort** and deployment errors.

## 🔄 ETL & CI/CD Workflow

- ETL code written in **PySpark** and packaged as a **Python Wheel (.whl)**.
- **GitHub Actions** triggers on code push:
  1. Builds the Wheel file.
  2. Uploads the latest artifact to **S3**.
  3. Ensures **version-controlled ETL code** in Glue.

---

## 📊 Analytics & BI Consumption

- Data queried using **Amazon Athena** and connected via **ODBC**.
- Visualized in **Power BI, Redash, or Metabase**.
- **Lake Formation** governs table-level and column-level permissions.

---

## ✅ Key Benefits

- **Fully Automated:** No manual console clicks.
- **Secure:** VPC-based ingestion and encrypted S3 buckets.
- **Scalable:** Serverless architecture handles growing data volumes.
- **Standardized:** Medallion architecture ensures data quality.
